- [ ] Our RecyclerView rows just show the title for each post. It should
  show title, author, summary, and publish date.
I have completed this by updating the data with author, summary & publish date 

- [ ] The UI is bare-bones right now. It should look nicer.
Changed the UI with constraint layout and aligned the text to look nicer.

- [ ] The networking code is duplicated in both of our activities. We should
  clean that up.
Clean the networking code and added in the Service class.

- [ ] There are no tests. It'd be nice to have some tests to verify the quality of
  our work. This could require refactoring the architecture.
Refactor the code using MVVM(Model-View-ViewModel) architecture and added few testcases for view model.
